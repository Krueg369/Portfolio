# Portfolio
This repository compiles programs I've created in both C++ and Python. These projects range from physics research using C++ and the ROOT data analysis framework to simple projects done in python. 

About Each Program: 

  spatial.C:
  This was one of the first programs I created as an undergraduate researcher. The program was created with C++ and is run in the Root data analysis framework on     linux. The program reads data in from files containing information from the MINOS neutrino experiment. From there, I anylize two conditions; First I calculate the 
  angular difference between neutrinos in a cosmic ray event where the number of tracks is greater than 2. Next, a similar calculation is made for the number of       tracks in an event equal to 2. The result of running this program is two histograms, one for ntracks > 2 and the other for ntracks == 2.
